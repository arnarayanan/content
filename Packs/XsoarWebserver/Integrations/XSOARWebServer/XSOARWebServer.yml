description: 'This is a simple web-server that as of now, supports handling configurable
  user responses (like Yes/No/Maybe). What makes it different from Data collection
  tasks is that, the URL to perform a certain action is predictable and written to
  the incident context when an action is setup. This URL can be inserted to for eg:
  an HTML email.  User clicks are  are recorded in the integration context and can
  be polled by Scheduled Commands / Generic Polling'
